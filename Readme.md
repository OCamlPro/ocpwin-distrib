OCamlPro's version of OCaml on Windows
======================================

See [TypeRex's page on OCPWin](http://www.typerex.org/ocpwin.html)

This is an experiment to provide a self-contained OCaml distribution
for Windows. You can download the ZIP archive, extract the files where
you want, add the `bin` directory to your PATH, and you can start
using OCaml bytecode and native compilers. In particular, you don't need
to install Cygwin to use this distribution

We only provide binary releases. If you are interested in getting an
open-source copy of the sources for your own needs, or in clarifying
other licensing issues, contact
[sales@ocamlpro.com](mailto:sales@ocamlpro.com).
